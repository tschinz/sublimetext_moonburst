## Conclusion

Again, all the hardwork was done by the Stanley Rost creator of original Sunburst. This is a simple lazy fork of it where I:

* * Picked new colors
* Modified a few things
* Added italic support

Give him all credit for the original theme work. Hope you guys like this one! It's free for all. Thanks!
